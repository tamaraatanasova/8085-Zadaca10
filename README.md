# 8085 exercise no.10

Due to increased reliability in the operation of the system for
supervision two µP 8085 are used. Both µP 8085 execute
9 the same program located in the corresponding ROM memory. To
projects an auxiliary "non-intelligent" circuit that will force
TRAP signal in all cases when the calculated data in
the two µP differs.

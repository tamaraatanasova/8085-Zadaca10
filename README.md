# 8085 exercise no.10

8085 based microprocessor system serves for
temperature control. The control is performed every 0.5 s.
If the temperature read is in the interval between
two boundary temperatures, located at the top of the stack, are
lights up a green light bulb, and vice versa, a red light bulb lights up and
the processor stops working. The temperature comes after
interrupt sequence.
